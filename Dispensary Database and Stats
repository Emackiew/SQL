This code is for an example dispensary data base. I first created a table, listed strains of medical marijuana, then organized them by strength and price.
I chose medical marijuana for this project because of the many characteristics strains of marijuana can have, to show case my abilities to sort and organize 
by these  characteristics.

The "create table" begins the entire process by defining the primary item we're analyzing. 
Then "Text" and "Integers" will create the columns I will use to insert the statistics of the individual strains.
Finally, I will use the INSERT INTO functions to define what those statistics are, such as name, strength and price.
After that I will use a basic "order by" function to organize them in a linear fashion starting from lowest price to highest.

CREATE TABLE THCSHOP (id integer primary key, TYPE TEXT, STRAIN TEXT, THC INTEGER, PRICE INTEGER);

INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (1, "HYRBID", "BLUEDREAM", 21, 23.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (2, "INDICA", "PURPLE HAZE", 19, 19.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (3, "SATIVA", "SOUR DIESEL", 25, 27.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (4, "HYBRID", "AFGHAN KUSH", 20, 19.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (5, "INDICA", "WEDDING CAKE", 24, 25.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (6, "SATIVA", "RUNTS", 21, 21.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (7, "HYRBID", "OG KUSH", 18, 18.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (8, "INDICA", "GRANDDADDY PURPLE", 17, 15.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (9, "SATIVA", "NORTHERN LIGHTS", 18, 16.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (10, "HYBRID", "LONDON POUND CAKE", 20, 19.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (11, "INDICA", "SUNDAY DRIVER", 22, 23.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (12, "SATIVA", "APPLES AND BANANAS", 24, 25.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (13, "HYBRID", "ZOOKIES", 21, 23.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (14, "SATIVA", "DONNY BURGER", 27, 28.99);
INSERT INTO THCSHOP VALUES (15, "INDICA", "GRAPES AND CREAM", 25, 27.99);
SELECT * FROM THCSHOP ORDER BY PRICE
